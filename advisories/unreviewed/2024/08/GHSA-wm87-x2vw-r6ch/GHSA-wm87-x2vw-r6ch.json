  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: list_lru: fix UAF for memory cgroup\n\nThe mem_cgroup_from_slab_obj() is supposed to be called under rcu lock or\ncgroup_mutex or others which could prevent returned memcg from being\nfreed.  Fix it by adding missing rcu read lock.\n\nFound by code inspection.\n\n[songmuchun@bytedance.com: only grab rcu lock when necessary, per Vlastimil]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240801024603.1865-1-songmuchun@bytedance.com",
