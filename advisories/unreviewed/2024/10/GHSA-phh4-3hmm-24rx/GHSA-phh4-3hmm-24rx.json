On a Juju machine (non-Kubernetes) or Juju charm container (on Kubernetes), an unprivileged user in the same network namespace can connect to an abstract domain socket and guess the JUJU_CONTEXT_ID value. This gives the unprivileged user access to the same information and tools as the Juju charm.",
