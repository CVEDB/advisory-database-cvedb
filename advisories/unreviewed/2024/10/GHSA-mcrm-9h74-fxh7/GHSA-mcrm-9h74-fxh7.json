  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetkit: Assign missing bpf_net_context\n\nDuring the introduction of struct bpf_net_context handling for\nXDP-redirect, the netkit driver has been missed, which also requires it\nbecause NETKIT_REDIRECT invokes skb_do_redirect() which is accessing the\nper-CPU variables. Otherwise we see the following crash:\n\n\tBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000038\n\tbpf_redirect()\n\tnetkit_xmit()\n\tdev_hard_start_xmit()\n\nSet the bpf_net_context before invoking netkit_xmit() program within the\nnetkit driver.",
